# Project-0-My-App-Portfolio

First Java project in awhile. This is a simple app that lists future projects I will be completing for a Udacity course I'm taking. When the user clicks each button/project name a Toast pops to show the name of the app the user selected.

I also implemented a compatible style.xml and a material design style.xml for newer devices.
